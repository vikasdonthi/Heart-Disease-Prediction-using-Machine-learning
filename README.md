# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-learning
This project aims to develop a predictive model to assess the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on various medical attributes using machine learning techniques. Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and early detection can significantly improve the chances of effective treatment and manage.
# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview

This project is a machine learning-based application that predicts the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on medical diagnostic measurements. Early diagnosis can help in timely treatment, reducing the risk of serious cardiovascular problems.

The model is trained using various machine learning algorithms and evaluated to select the most accurate one. It uses the **Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset** from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Heart disease is a major cause of death globally. Detecting it at an early stage through predictive modeling can help save lives. By analyzing patient data (like blood pressure, cholesterol, age, etc.), we aim to create a model that can predict heart disease with high accuracy.
